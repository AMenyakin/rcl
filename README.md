# React component library

### Code editor extensions

This project shipped with configuration files for EditorConfig, ESlint, Stylelint. Also, it has settings for VSCode.
You can use these extensions in your code editor. In VSCode in addition, you should install Path Intellisense plugin for autocomplete paths to css/scss files within typescript files. If you work in some other editor, more likely you will need to configure the editor for working with these extensions properly.
